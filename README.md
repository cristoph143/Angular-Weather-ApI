## Angular Weather App

> Using **Angular and a weather API** of your choice, I want you to create a weather web app.
    How the web app will look will solely be up to you.

 

> The weather web app should do the following:

- [ ] Should allow me to search the location whose weather I want to check
- [ ] Should show the weather details of the chosen location
- [ ] Provide icons based on the weather conditions.
    e.g. Weather Condition is Partly Cloudy, you will show clouds on the UI
- [ ] Provide icons based on the current temperature.
    e.g. Temperature is 6 degrees Celsius, show a snowflake icon on the UI.
 

> How this will be graded:

- [ ] UI – 30%
- [ ] Functionality and features – 70%
